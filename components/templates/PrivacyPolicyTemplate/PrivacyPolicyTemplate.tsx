          <p>Under the CCPA, California residents have the following rights:</p>
          <ul style={{ listStyle: 'none' }}>
            <li>
              • The right to know, subject to certain exceptions:
              <ul style={{ listStyle: 'none' }}>
                <li>
                  o The categories of personal information we have collected
                  about you;
                </li>
                <li>
                  o The categories of sources from which the personal
                  information is collected;
                </li>
                <li>
                  o Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling
                  personal information;
                </li>
                <li>
                  o The categories of third parties with whom we share personal
                  information, if any; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  o The specific pieces of personal information we have
                  collected about you;
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              • The right to request deletion of your personal information,
              subject to certain exceptions;
            </li>
            <li>
              • The right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              • The right not to be discriminated against for exercising your
              CCPA rights.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To exercise your CCPA rights, you must submit a verifiable consumer
            request to us by email or mail addressed indicated below. To verify
            your request, HTI will send you a verification email. In making such
            a request, you must provide your full name, email address, and Suvie
            account number, if relevant. HTI has no reasonable method to verify
            requests from consumers who are not account holders as HTI does not
            maintain information in a manner that permits it to reasonably
            verify consumer requests from those who do not hold accounts with
            HTI. You may have an authorized agent submit a request to know or a
            request to delete so long as you provide the authorized agent with
            written permission to submit the relevant request and you verify
            your own identity directly with HTI. Such restrictions do not apply
            where you provide your authorized agent with power of attorney
            pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4121 to 4130.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTI will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your
            CCPA rights.
          </p>
