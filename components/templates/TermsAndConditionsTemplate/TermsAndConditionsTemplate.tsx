          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>a. Pledges and Pre-Orders.</strong> By pre-ordering any
              Products or Services from HTI or by making a pledge on a third
              party site (e.g., Kickstarter), you acknowledge and agree that you
              are making a donation to a work in progress and are not making a
              direct purchase. Your reward is the number of Products or Services
              you pre-order or pledge to support. If HTI is unable to fulfill
              your reward, the parties agree that these Terms will apply. HTI
              may cancel or refund your contribution at any time and for any
              reason, and if HTI does so, HTI is not required to fulfill the
              reward. You agree and acknowledge that these Products or Services
              may be delivered late or not at all, and that you may cancel your
              pledge prior to shipment for a full refund.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>b. Orders.</strong> You agree that your order is an offer
              to buy, under these Terms, all Products and Services listed in
              your order. All orders must be accepted by HTI or HTI will not be
              obligated to sell the Products or Services to you. HTI may choose
              not to accept any orders in HTI’s sole discretion. After having
              received your order, HTI will send you a confirmation e-mail with
              your order number and details of the items you have ordered.
              Acceptance of your order and the formation of the contract of sale
              between HTI and you will not take place unless and until you have
              received your order confirmation e-mail.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>c. Meal Subscriptions.</strong> We offer different
              subscription plans for meal ingredients (each, a “Meal
              Subscription”). The number of meals you receive and the amount you
              are charged may vary from week to week depending on the dietary
              preferences you select. For example, we may provide you with
              greater flexibility to choose the number of meals you receive each
              week. If your Meal Subscription changes, the applicable weekly
              Meal Subscription price may also change. Changes to your Meal
              Subscription, or other choices you may make (such as the number of
              meals you receive), may also result in changes to any applicable
              shipping and handling charges and meal delivery times. If we
              change the prices or other charges associated with our various
              Meal Subscription plans, we will provide you with notice of such
              changes, such as by email or a notice posted on our Sites. The
              fees for the Meal Subscriptions can be found on the Sites and may
              be subject to change in the future. Note that we do not currently
              deliver meal ingredients to every location, so you may not be able
              to order a Meal Subscription depending on your location.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>d. Continuous Subscriptions.</strong> WHEN YOU REGISTER
              FOR A MEAL SUBSCRIPTION, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT
              (A) HTI (OR OUR THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR) IS AUTHORIZED TO
              CHARGE YOU ON A WEEKLY BASIS FOR YOUR MEAL SUBSCRIPTION (IN
              ADDITION TO ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) FOR AS LONG AS
              YOUR MEAL SUBSCRIPTION CONTINUES, (B) THE AMOUNT YOU ARE CHARGED
              AND THE NUMBER OF MEALS YOU RECEIVE EACH WEEK MAY VARY DEPENDING
              ON THE PREFERENCES YOU SELECT, AND (C) YOUR MEAL SUBSCRIPTION IS
              CONTINUOUS UNTIL YOU CANCEL IT OR WE SUSPEND OR STOP PROVIDING
              ACCESS TO THE SITES OR PRODUCTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS.
              YOU MAY SKIP YOUR WEEKLY MEAL ORDER AS OFTEN AS YOU’D LIKE BY

            <li>
              <strong>e. Cancellation Policy.</strong> YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR MEAL
              SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME BY EMAILING help@suvie.com. ANY MEAL
              ORDER IDENTIFIED AS “SHIPPED” ON THE SITES HAS BEEN PROCESSED AND
              CANNOT BE CANCELLED. YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL CHARGES
              (INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) INCURRED WITH
              RESPECT TO ANY MEAL ORDER PROCESSED PRIOR TO THE CANCELLATION OF
              YOUR MEAL SUBSCRIPTION. In the event you cancel your Meal
              Subscription, please note that we may still send you promotional
              communications about HTI unless you opt out of receiving those
              communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided
              therein.

          <h2>4. Prices and Payment Terms</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              a. All prices posted on the Sites are subject to change without
              notice. The price charged for a Product or Service will be the
              price in effect at the time the order is placed and will be set
              out in your order confirmation e-mail. Posted prices do not
              include taxes or charges for shipping and handling. All such taxes
              and charges will be added to your merchandise total and will be
              itemized in your shopping cart and in your order confirmation
              e-mail. HTI is not responsible for pricing, typographical, or
              other errors in any offer by HTI and HTI reserves the right to
              cancel any orders arising from such errors. For Meal
              Subscriptions, we will provide advance notice of any price changes
              in accordance with Section 3. We will not, however, be able to
              notify you of any changes in any applicable taxes. The shipment of
              Products under a Meal Subscription to you after our delivery of
              such notice will confirm your acceptance of such changes, unless
              you cancel your Meal Subscription in accordance with the
              cancellation policies set forth in Section 3.
            </li>
            <li>
              b. Terms of payment are within HTI’s sole discretion and, unless
              otherwise agreed by us in writing, payment must be received by us
              before our acceptance of an order. You represent and warrant that
              (i) the credit card information you supply to us is true, correct,
              and complete, (ii) you are duly authorized to use such credit card
              for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by
              your credit card company, and (iv) you will pay charges incurred
              by you at the posted prices, including all applicable taxes, if
              any.

            <li>
              c. All of our Products are subject to availability, and we reserve
              the right to impose quantity limits on any order, to reject all or
              part of an order, to discontinue offering certain Products and to
              substitute Products (including, but not limited to, specific meal
              ingredients) without prior notice. We strive to provide you with
              high-quality Products, and given the perishable nature of certain
              Products and market conditions beyond our control, we may be
              required to make substitutions from time to time. If you are not
              satisfied with a substitution, please contact us at
              help@suvie.com.

              for specifications, except where specific tolerances are agreed to
              in writing at the time of order. HTI reserves the right to make
              substitutions and modifications in the specifications of any
              hardware Products provided that such substitutions or
              modifications do not materially affect the performance of such
              hardware Products or the purposes for which they can be used.

              offers (“Offers”). The terms of these Offers will be outlined on
              our website, be available for your review prior to your purchase,

              with the terms of such Offer including, without limitation,
              purchasing and maintaining a Meal Subscription for a certain

              that requires a minimum purchase of Meal Subscriptions, HTI
              reserves the right to charge you for such purchases and issue you
              a Credit in the amount charged. Offers may be limited in duration
              and expire pursuant to the terms of the Offer. If you have any

              HTI may, from time to time, issue coupons or discounts on its
              Products and Services. These coupons and discounts are not
              cumulative, and only the highest discount will be applied to a
              single order. Discounts and coupons may be limited in duration and
              expire pursuant to the terms of such discount and coupon. If you

            the individual Product page for specific delivery options. You shall
            pay all shipping and handling charges specified during the ordering
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Title and risk of loss pass to you upon HTI’s transfer of the
            Products to the carrier. Shipping and delivery dates are estimates
            only and cannot be guaranteed. HTI is not liable for any delays in
            shipments. All shipments will be made at your risk, and you shall be
            responsible for making all claims with carriers, insurers,
            warehousemen and others for misdelivery, nondelivery, loss, damage
            or delay.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for inspecting all Products you receive from us
            for any damage or other issues upon delivery. After receipt of the
            Products, you agree to immediately inform us of any damage to the
            Products of which you become aware that may render them unsafe for
            use, and agree that your further use of any such Products shall be
            solely at your risk. In addition, you are solely responsible for
            determining the freshness of the Products you receive. We recommend
            that you use a thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature
            of any meat, poultry or seafood Product is 40°F or below. In the
            unlikely event that such temperature is above 40°F, or you have any
            other reason to believe that any other Product in your delivery is
            not suitable for consumption, contact us at help@suvie.com and
            discard the item. To maintain the quality and integrity of the
            Products, we recommend that you immediately refrigerate all
            perishable Products upon delivery and follow the U.S. Department of
            Agriculture’s (“USDA”) instructions on refrigeration and food
            safety, safe food handling, and recommendations on food consumption
            for at-risk groups, which can be found on the USDA’s website.

            HTI offers the following warranty for a period ending one year from
            the date of purchase, provided that HTI may offer the opportunity to
            purchase an extended warranty (such period, the “Warranty Period”).
            For the Warranty Period, so long as any hardware Product is operated
            and maintained for non-commercial use according to the instructions
            attached to or furnished with such hardware Product (the
            “Specifications”), HTI will pay for the repair costs to correct
            defects in materials or workmanship, provided that HTI reserves the
            right to charge for reasonable costs associated with labor. Service
            must be provided by a service company designated by HTI. Customer is
            responsible for a $49 fee to cover the cost of shipping and
            handling. Product must be returned in original packaging. If
            customer does not have original packaging, HTI can provide a
            replacement for the cost of packaging plus shipping and handling.
            This warranty does not cover accessories including, but not limited
            to, pans, water reservoir, drain tray, power cable and other
            removable parts. This warranty also does not cover cosmetic damage
            to the oven that does not affect its function, cleaning abrasions or
            alterations to the external surface of the oven shell or oven door
            glass. This warranty only covers appliances shipped to and located

            The warranties in this Section 6 shall only apply if you provide
            your original purchase invoice for the applicable hardware Product,
            and such hardware Product must be acquired from HTI as a new Product
            and not as auction, resale, liquidation, etc. This warranty does not

            shall be extended for the time period of such delay or HTI may, at
            its option, cancel any order or remaining part thereof without
            liability by giving notice of such cancellation to you. In the event
            that HTI experiences a force majeure event, HTI, in its sole
            discretion, may accept cancellations of orders of Products that have
            not yet shipped.

          <p>
            If you are dissatisfied with a meal received from the meal
            subscription and delivery Service for any reason, please contact us
            at help@suvie.com within seven (7) days of the date you received the
            meal. Depending on the circumstances, we may, in our sole
            discretion, replace the meal or meal ingredient at our expense,
            provide you a full or partial refund of the purchase price for that
            meal or meal ingredient, or provide you with Credits for that meal
            or meal ingredient that will automatically be applied to future
            deliveries under your Meal Subscription. We may require the return
            or photographic documentation of any meal or meal ingredient that
            you are dissatisfied with before we provide you a refund,
            replacement, or Credit.
          </p>
          <p>
            In certain circumstances, we may provide you full or partial
            customer experience credits of promotional value that will
            automatically be applied to your next eligible order under your Meal
            Subscription (“Credits”). Credits may only be redeemed for the type
            of Product they were issued, are promotional in nature, are not
            transferable, and are not redeemable for cash or other property.
            Credits only remain available if you maintain both a valid Suvie
            account and an active Meal Subscription. That means that if you
            cancel your Meal Subscription, any outstanding Credits associated
            with your cancelled subscription will immediately expire. You may
            only redeem Credits after they are applied to your Suvie account. If
            for some reason you believe that there is a discrepancy regarding
            your Credit balance, please contact us at help@suvie.com. All
            decisions regarding your Credit balance will be determined in our
            sole discretion and are final.

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              a. For non-food Products pre-ordered or purchased from third
              parties or via third party sites (e.g., Kickstarter, Indiegogo),
              HTI will not be accepting returns. Any returns shall be subject to
              the return policy of the third party from whom you purchased such
              non-food Product, if any, and HTI shall have no obligation to
              process returns of any such Products.
            </li>
            <li>
              b. For non-food Products pre-ordered or purchased directly from
              HTI (including Suvie appliances): if you are unsatisfied with your
              purchase of a non-food Product from suvie.com for any reason, you
              may request a full refund of such Product excluding shipping and
              handling fees (excluding Kickstarter pre-orders). To qualify for a
              refund, all of the following conditions must be met:
            </li>
            <li>
              i. A return authorization must be requested from our customer
              service team within 100 days to request a return authorization. To
              request a return authorization, please contact us at
              help@suvie.com.
            </li>
            <li>
              ii. You must return the Product and its Specifications to HTI to
              receive a refund. Returned Product(s) must be in good physical
              condition (not physically broken or damaged). All accessories and
              packaging originally included with your purchase, including the
              product UPC barcode, must be included with your return.
            </li>
            <li>
              iii. The return authorization number must be included along with
              your returned product.
            </li>
            <li>
              iv. Shipping and handling charges, gift wrap fees, and taxes paid
              (such as state, customs, or VAT) are not refundable. You are
              responsible for and must prepay all shipping charges and you
              assume the risk of loss or damage to the returned Product(s) while
              in transit back to HTI. If the product is purchased starting
              January 24th 2020 and returned to us within 100 days of purchase
              you are eligible for a shipping refund on your initial purchase if
              the product is returned without damage. If you return a Product to
              HTI (a) without a return authorization from HTI or (b) without all
              parts and accessories originally included with your purchase, HTI
              retains the right to either refuse acceptance of such return or
              charge you a restocking fee of 15% of the original price of the
              Product(s) or the retail value of the missing parts and
              accessories, whichever is higher.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In the event that HTI becomes aware of any defect, error, deficiency
            or other issue with the Product that could pose a risk to the safety
            of any person or property, or in the event any government authority
            requests or requires HTI to issue a product recall, HTI may
            immediately, with or without notice, disable the functionality of
            and/or require the immediate return of such affected Product (a
            “Recall Event”). Except as otherwise required by law, HTI shall not
            be liable for any such losses or liabilities resulting from a Recall
            Event.

            challenge that the arbitration provision or the Agreement is void,
            voidable or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator will be empowered to
            grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in
            equity. Any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on
            each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of
            competent jurisdiction.

          <p>
            If you prevail on any claim that affords the prevailing party
            attorneys` fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to you
            under the standards for fee shifting provided by law.

            power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration
            waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be
            raised in a court of competent jurisdiction.
